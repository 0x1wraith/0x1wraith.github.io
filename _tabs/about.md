<p style="border-left : 5px #1E90FF solid; padding-left: 15px;"> Hello, I'm Hossam, passionate about cybersecurity and highly motivated to continuously learn. I have built a solid foundation in Linux fundamentals, networking, and cryptography. I have completed OWASP Top 10 and actively hone my practical skills by solving CTF challenges on platforms such as TryHackMe and Hack The Box. </p>
